I"Ø<p>Youâ€™re live! Nice. Weâ€™ve put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, itâ€™s a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>

<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Item number one</li>
  <li>Item number two
    <ul>
      <li>A nested item</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remember to buy some milk</li>
  <li>Drink the milk</li>
  <li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - itâ€™ll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Hereâ€™s a link to <a href="http://ghost.org">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-images">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src="https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo" /></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? Thatâ€™s ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isnâ€™t enough, you want to quote someone on what theyâ€™ve said. Perhaps youâ€™ve started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ghost - Just a blogging platform</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="working-with-code">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? Weâ€™ve got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="ready-for-a-break">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and youâ€™ve got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="advanced-usage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>Thereâ€™s one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and itâ€™ll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" /></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>
