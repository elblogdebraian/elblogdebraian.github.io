This project has been pre-configured to work with [Forestry](https://forestry.io) a git-based CMS, [import your repository in Forestry](https://app.forestry.io/quick-start?repo=DirtyF/hugo-twenty-twenty-forestry&engine=hugo&version=0.74.3) and you'll be able to edit and preview your site ✨. \

Any changes you make in Forestry will be commited back to the repo and automatically deployed, e.g with [Vercel](#vercel) or [Netlify](#netlify).

## Local development

```bash
# clone your imported repository
# cd in the project directory
# Start local dev server
hugo server
```
